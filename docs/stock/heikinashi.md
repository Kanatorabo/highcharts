Candlestick chart
================

A Heiken Ashi series is typically used to present the modified open, high, low and close price over a period of time. 
A Heiken Ashi chart is composed of a body and an upper and a lower wick similarly to the candlestick. The only difference is that the open, high, low and close values had been modified by the formula.
